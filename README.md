A tiny webapp for keeping a budget.

budget-keeper tracks your expenditures via simple email messages.

At its core, it's just a fancy email client that looks for messages
you send to it that look like notes for your purchases and expenses.


Usage
-----

Send yourself an email with a subject like "Paid $14.57 for Groceries."
budget-keeper will then add a $14.57 entry to the budget category "Groceries".

At the moment there's no real way to view your current budgets and expenditures.
